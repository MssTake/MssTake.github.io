# Things to Do

## Function

- get theme buttons to work
- less scrolling; more hidden objects
- less buttons; more hover elements

## Personal

- consider humanizing yourself in the bio
- picture of yourself
- add link to senior project https://www.fit.edu/student-design-showcase/showcase-2024/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/
- add a link to your instagram when you add more photos to it
- make a credits page for the wallpapers

## Style

- save space for copies of my diplomas (eventually)
- put a rubber duck on the desk
- the site is really ugly when resized. "lock the computer" until it is resized past a certain point
- a pop-up encouraging people to resize the window. pop-up should leave the frame when the window is resized
- change cursor when you enter the screen <div>

### Body

- past experience should be visible in the blog window
- tumblr themes should be accessible through "toolbar"

### Footer

- footer should look like a desk
- tutor page should be accessible through a book
- art should be accessible through a sketchbook button

## Work Samples

- find more work/code samples
- tumblr themes, if you ever make them
- add more art samples
